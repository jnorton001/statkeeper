    Note: unless otherwise agree upon, the winner should enter the match
    details.  This will avoid duplicate submissions.  If the winner
    doesn't want to claim their victory, that's their problem.

      Put the winner's score first, so if the winner won the
      first game 21-15, lost the second 21-18 and won the third 24-22,
      then put "21-15,18-21,24-22".  (Leave blank if you don't care.)
